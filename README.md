One-Class Classification using Autoencoders: An
autoencoder-based approach was employed to classify tweets
Architecture: An encoder compressed the input features
into a latent representation of 16 dimensions. A decoder
reconstructed the input from this latent representation. Train-
ing: The autoencoder was trained using only real tweets,
with reconstruction loss ( Mean Squared Error) used as the
optimization objective.
